    <p>On August 11, 1919, the Green Bay Packers were founded by Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun. In 1921, is when they joined the American Professional Football Association, which is now the National Football League today. Something that makes the Packers organization unique is that they are the only publicly owned professional sports team in the United States. Remarkably, the Packers have taken home thirteen league championships through their one hundred seasons; this is the most by any NFL team. Some of the Packers most famous stadiums include City Stadium, Milwaukee County Stadium, and Lambeau Field, where the Packer fans, known as 'Cheeseheads' currently reside and cheer on the 'Green and Gold'.</p>
